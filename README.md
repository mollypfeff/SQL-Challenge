# SQL-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Module 9 Challenge due on 12/19. All of the work present has been created by myself, Molly Pfefferkorn. My instructor, Dr. Carl Arrington, provided troubleshooting feedback during the designated office hours of this class. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
-------------------------------------
This project involves working with historical employee data from the fictional company Pewlett Hackard, using six provided CSV files. The goal was to design an SQL database schema, import the data, and perform analysis to answer various queries about the company's workforce. The project is divided into three parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. 

In the Data Modeling phase, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to visualize the relationships between the tables, ensuring the database schema is structured with appropriate primary and foreign keys. 

The Data Engineering phase involved writing SQL scripts to define tables, set data types, enforce data integrity, and import the CSV data while maintaining relationships. 

Lastly, in the Data Analysis phase, various SQL queries were executed to extract insights, such as employee details, information on employees hired in 1986, department managers, employee department info, employees named Hercules, employees in the Sales department, and a frequency count of employee last names.
